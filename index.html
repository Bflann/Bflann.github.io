							<h1>Brendan Flannagan</h1>
							<p>I am a student at the University of Michigan pursuing a degree in computer science and cognitive science. I am working toward my goal of becoming a video game developer. In addition to being a student, I am a part of Lights Out Studio. This site has examples of games that I have designed either by myself or in a group.</p>

							<h2><a href="https://lightsoutstudios.itch.io/flickernaut">Flickernaut</a></h2>
							<p>Flickernaut is a stealth-puzzle game developed by Lights Out Studio.  The game follows a stranded astronaut who must progress through puzzles which can only be solved by teleporting to a dark, dangerous, alien-infested dimension and lighting torches whose power help clear the way in the light dimension.</p>

									<p>This is a prototype for a small web game. It involves a lovable character that can flip upsidedown to get to places no one thought they could</p>

							<p>In addition to games I have spent time working on some web development and some machine learning projects.</p>

									<h3>Human Rights First</h3>
									<p>I spent the entire year of 2020 developing a resource locator for asylum seekers coming into the United States. The website lets asylum seekers search for useful resources that rarely appear on general use services like Google Maps. This project was developed in partnership with Human Rights First, a non-profit which focuses on helping asylum seekers get legal support as they navigate the asylum process. The website is not currently publicly available, but is planned to be launched in early 2021.</p>

									<h3>AI detection of follicles in human ovaries</h3>
									<p>I am currently working in the Shikanov lab at the University of Michigan where I am designing a program to recognize follicles in human ovaries. The program uses deep neural networks to detect the locations of follicles and then uses the information to count them. Our goal is to finish the project before May 2021.</p>
